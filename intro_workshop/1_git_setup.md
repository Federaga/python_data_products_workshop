# Objectives

* Learn how to **collaborate**
* Understand importance of **issue trackers**
* Learn basics of git and github

# Steps

1. Install git on your PC. Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Create a user account on github: https://github.com/
3. Create a task  named "do git setup exercise" here https://github.com/acivitillo/python_data_products_workshop/issues. You can do it by openning issue: Click link mentioned above --> New Issue --> Give it a title ;)
4. On github.com click `Fork`. This will replicate the master repository into your account
5. Clone your repository to your local pc by typing `git clone [your git link here]` in your command line (`cmd` on windows)
6. Add your sentence to submissions.txt (you can use the standard notebook application on your pc)
7. Inside the terminal do `git add .` then `git commit -m "first commit"` then `git push`
8. Finally go back to github.com. Go to `pull requests` and click `create pull request`
9. Close your task on the issue tracker

# Moving forward

* **Remember** from now you will create an issue in the tracker for each task you do. If you have problems performing a task ask me inside the issue directly
* Use the issue tracker of this repo to **ask me questions** now and after this intro_workshop
* Build your projects in github from the beginning
* Build up your curriculum on github by submitting your work there
